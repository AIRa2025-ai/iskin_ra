-- README (quick steps):
-- 1) Put ra_imbalance.mq5 into MQL5/Experts/ and compile in MetaEditor. Attach EA to chart(s) and enable AlgoTrading.
-- 2) In MT5, EA writes ra_zones.json into Terminal\MQL5\Files (this folder). Find it and set that folder path into ra_config.json -> data_path.
-- 3) On the same machine, install Python, pip install MetaTrader5, then run ra_brain.py (it will read ra_zones.json). Adjust config.
-- 4) Commit these files to your GitHub repo under a folder like /ra/mt5_ea/ and push.


-- Notes:
-- This is minimal, defensive first-version: it detects simple FVG patterns and exports them. Next steps: de-duplicate zone detection, add expiration, add confluence (S/R, daily levels), backtest rules, add order placement module, add Telegram notifications and GPT integration.
